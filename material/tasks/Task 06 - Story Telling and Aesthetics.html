# Lab - Story Telling and Aesthetics

These tasks provide an opportunity for you to try out and experiment with visualization concepts (e.g., creating, developing and custimizing a visualization for a specific problem/story).

## Thinking about Visualization

Visualisations deliver persuasive arguments because they increase message clarity by presenting complex data in a visual context. However, the visual aspect means that even subtle imperfections can disproportionately weaken the argument being made and the credence of the data analysis work. Therefore, in data science visualisations should be considered carefully and resourced accordingly.

The type of visualisations you will use and work with range from simple line graphs indicating trends over time, to geospatial maps with multiple layers for filters, to dashboards containing a mix of all the above. Interactions within visualisations ranging from basic filtering on a single dataset, to cohort selection where entirely diverse datasets are integrated into a coherent picture. What you'll learn is that visualisations is a complex beast, that is very powerful and useful.

# Chernoff Faces

Visualizations can be more than just bar charts, and example of this is Chernoff Faces. The Chernoff Faces method is a data visualization technique brought to us in the 70's. It was developed by Herman Chernoff to represent multivariate data, ostensibly effectively representing up to 18 variables. Facial features(eyes, nose, eyebrows) are mapped to multiple variables, with size, orientation, shape, color, and placement potentially representing different attributes of a single observation.

# Tasks

**Exercise:** Spend some time researching a visualization idea of your choosing (e.g., weather, social media, health, cost of living, news, nature).  Discuss your idea with a colleague or someone in the lab (help you clarify and compose your idea).

**Exercise:** For your visualization idea, answer the following questions:

* What is it that you're trying to communicate/visualize?
* Do you have the data to answer the questions?
* If not, what data do you need to collect?
* Can the data be accessed?
* Is the data accurate?
* Does the data need to be manipulated/converted?
* What visuals will you use to communicate your information? 
* What do you want to show? (e.g., pattern?, trends?, does it tell a story or just show graphs?)
* Does your visualization raise new questions?
* Is your visualization easy to understand?



**Exercise:** On a single A4 piece of paper 'sketch' your visualization (also detail any interactive features/information).  The sketch doesn't need to be perfect, just to help you clarify the types of graphs/layout/size/functional components.  Remember the visualization should not just be a static graphic on screen - think about how it would animate/change over time or as the user interacts and selects components. Don't limit your design to what you know about D3 currently - that's why you should be using a pen and paper (not limited by your creative thinking).


**Exercise:** Detail how you would implement your design using D3 (e.g., how would you structure your code, data formats, any calculations/graphics you'd need to acquire).
